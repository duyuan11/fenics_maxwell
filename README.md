FEniCS Maxwell
==============

Some FEniCS programs for solving Maxwell's equations in some special cases. 

__maxwell_eigs_simple.py__

First trial in FEniCS to implement the Maxwell eigenvalue problem in 2D/3D using Nedelec elements
(here compared with the Laplace eigenvalue problem using Lagrange elements).
This is basically the FEniCS eigenvalue demo program modified to solve the Maxwell eigenvalue problem.
